## Scripts used for declarative environment boostrapping

### Webtop
Webtop is a super convenient way to quickly declaratively deploy a remote ubuntu-xfce intance with built in VNC using docker compose. Environment spins up and is ready to use in seconds.  Instances are ephemeral and have no persistent storage other than explcitly declared files or folders explicitly declared in the compose.yml file.
