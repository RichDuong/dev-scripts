## Scripts used for declarative environment boostrapping

### Webtop
Webtop is a super convenient way to quickly declaratively deploy a remote ubuntu-xfce intance with built in VNC using docker compose. Environment spins up and is ready to use in seconds.  Instances are ephemeral so there is no persistent storage other files or folders explicitly declared within the compose.yml file.
